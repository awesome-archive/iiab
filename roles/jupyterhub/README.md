## JupyterHub programming environment with student Notebooks

#### High Schools may want to consider JupyterHub to integrate coding with dynamic interactive graphing — A New Way to Think About Programming — allowing students to integrate science experiment results and program output within their notebook/document/blog:

* Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in the scientific community.
* This IIAB package permits individual users to start using their own notebook on the server (http://box.lan/jupyterhub) without needing an individual server account.
* Once a user signs in with a username and password, these credentials are stored, and are used thereafter to gain access to the user's files.
* Individual folders are created for all student work in the path `/var/lib/protected/` &mdash; individual students will only be able to see their own work in that directory.
* Students will not have any privileges outside of their own folder.
* They may upload Jupyter Notebooks from a local machine, and download the current state of their work via a normal browser download.
